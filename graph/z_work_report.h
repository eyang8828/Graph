/*
    Features:
        -Not Implemented: not that I know of
        -Implemented: The Answer to pp 15.1 15.2 and 15.3 with their testing function
        -Partly implemented: not that I know of

    Reflections:
        The function that try get the shortest distance from the begin and end took
        me a lot of time to figure out, it's quite complicated to resolve the bug
        in between the code, because the logic is quite complicated.
